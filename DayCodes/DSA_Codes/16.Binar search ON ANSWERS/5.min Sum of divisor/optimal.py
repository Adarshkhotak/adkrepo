"""
Time Complexity:
The binary search algorithm runs in O(log m) time, where m is the maximum value in the nums list. 
For each iteration of the binary search, the getThreshold function is called, which runs in O(n) time, 
where n is the number of elements in the nums list. 
Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n log m).

Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this code is O(1) because it uses a constant amount of extra 
space regardless of the input size.
